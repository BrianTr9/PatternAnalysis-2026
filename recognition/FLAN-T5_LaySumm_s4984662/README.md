# Lay Summarisation of Radiology Reports with FLAN-T5: LoRA vs Full Fine-Tuning, and a Clinical Safety Autopsy

COMP3710 Pattern Recognition (UQ, Semester 2 2026), Project 2.6, FLAN-T5 (Hard).
Author: Trung Bao Truong (Brian Truong), student ID 49846627 (s4984662).

Patients increasingly read their own chest X-ray reports, which are written for physicians. This project fine-tunes **FLAN-T5-base** (247.6M parameters, encoder-decoder) to rewrite a radiology report in plain language, using the BioLaySumm 2025 *LaymanRRG* open-source track (150,454 training pairs). It compares a **zero-shot baseline**, **LoRA** (r = 8 and 16, 0.36% and 0.72% of the parameters) and **full fine-tuning** on identical splits, prompt and decoding, then asks the question that ROUGE cannot answer: *does a fine-tuned model stay clinically faithful, or only fluent?* Five validation cases, chosen by a rule fixed before looking at them, are read by hand.

## Summary of results

| | Zero-shot | LoRA r=8 | LoRA r=16 | Full FT |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ROUGE-Lsum, full validation (10,000) | 29.3 | 70.7 | 71.3 | **73.6** |
| ROUGE-Lsum, clean tier (4,037: new report, new study) | 30.3 | 66.4 | 67.2 | **70.2** |
| Trainable parameters | 0 | 884,736 (0.36%) | 1,769,472 (0.72%) | 247,577,856 (100%) |
| Peak GPU memory, training (GiB) | n/a | 15.1 | 15.1 | 19.6 |
| Generation time (s / report) | 0.377 | 0.172 | 0.162 | **0.101** |
| Reading grade (Flesch-Kincaid; source report 14.4) | 15.1 | 7.6 | 7.5 | 7.5 |

* Fine-tuning adds **41 to 44 ROUGE-Lsum points** and moves the text from the source's reading level (grade 14 to 15) to that of the references (grade 7.5). Full FT is best on every tier and fastest to generate; LoRA trains 0.4 to 0.7% of the parameters and its checkpoint is 3.4 to 6.8 MB instead of about 1 GB.
* 45.1% of the official validation reports also occur in training. This inflates the full-validation score by only **3 to 4 points** (full validation against the clean tier).
* **ROUGE missed the clinically relevant errors found in the autopsy:** an invented cause and a wrong location in a case scoring 0.64 to 0.72, a self-contradicting sentence, a long report silently truncated before its conclusion, and outputs that copy the source (Section 9.3).
* **Recommendation (Section 9.5): no-go for autonomous patient-facing use; conditional go for a clinician-in-the-loop drafting pilot** behind guardrails.

## 1. Problem and algorithm

**Problem.** A chest X-ray report such as "Subsegmental atelectasis in the left base. No pleural effusion." is accurate but written for clinicians. A patient who reads it in an online portal may be confused or alarmed. The task is to produce a short, plain-language version (about grade-6 reading level) that keeps every finding, every negation and the degree of certainty. In this setting an error is not a small loss of quality: inventing a tumour, dropping a pneumothorax or turning "suspected" into "confirmed" harms the reader, while the usual metric (ROUGE) only counts overlapping words.

**How it works.** FLAN-T5 is an encoder-decoder Transformer that was already instruction-tuned. The input is the instruction *"Rewrite the following radiology report in plain language that a patient can understand:"* followed by the report, cut to 512 tokens. The encoder reads it; the decoder writes the summary one token at a time, trained with teacher forcing and a cross-entropy loss that ignores padding (label -100). Decoding uses beam search with 4 beams. Three configurations share this pipeline: the frozen model (zero-shot), **LoRA** (the weights stay frozen and each attention query and value matrix `W` gets a trainable low-rank update `(alpha/r) B A`, `A` being r x k and `B` being d x r with `B` initialised to 0), and **full fine-tuning** (all weights updated). The training loop, loss, schedule and evaluation are written by hand (no Hugging Face `Trainer`), as required by the teaching staff.

## 2. Feasibility review

*(One-page review presented at the check-off, reproduced as submitted. The measurements it anticipated are in Section 9.)*

**Dilemma.** Does fine-tuning keep lay summaries clinically faithful, or only more fluent (high ROUGE, unsafe)?

### 2.1 User need, scope and acceptance criteria
**User and purpose.** Patients read chest X-ray reports in a health portal; a clinician reviews flagged summaries. The prototype decides whether a fine-tuned FLAN-T5 (LoRA vs full FT) stays faithful to the source report, and which guardrails it needs before release.

| # | Acceptance criterion (testable) |
|---|---|
| AC1 | ROUGE-1/2/L/Lsum for **zero-shot, LoRA and full FT** on the same validation split, on the full split and on the subset whose report does not appear in train. |
| AC2 | **Resource:** LoRA trains <= 1% of parameters; every configuration trains within 40 GB peak VRAM (fits either A100 size); total/trainable parameters, peak VRAM and tokens/s are reported for all three. |
| AC3 | Autopsy of 3 to 5 validation cases graded for (a) hallucination, (b) omission of acute findings, (c) lay readability, with root causes; states whether any high-ROUGE case is clinically wrong. |
| AC4 | Recommendation names >= 2 concrete guardrails and gives a go/no-go verdict with the quality-safety-cost trade-off. |

### 2.2 Model choice and course concepts
- **Data and model.** 150,454 / 10,000 / 10,537 train/val/test. Test references are withheld, so ROUGE is computed on validation, as the spec specifies. FLAN-T5-base (encoder-decoder, 247.6M parameters) [3, 4], Hard band; base size chosen to fit the compute budget. LoRA r = 8 on q/v gives 884,736 trainable parameters (0.36%).
- **Literature.** The top open-track system fine-tuned T5-large without LoRA [1, 2]; the only other open-track entry used QLoRA on decoder-only LLMs [1]. We found no LoRA [5] vs full-FT comparison for an encoder-decoder on this task.
- **Course concepts.** Leakage-free splitting (W5), at report level as there are no patient IDs; cross-entropy on logits, AdamW with LR schedule (W5, W6); target masking (pad labels = -100); Slurm batch jobs.

### 2.3 Preliminary feasibility evidence (data audit; computed, no GPU run)
- **Lengths (train, FLAN-T5 tokens).** Source median 31, p99 284; reference median 41, p99 296. Only 0.19% / 0.24% exceed 512, so 512-token truncation affects at most 0.43% of rows.
- **Leakage.** 45.1% of validation rows have a source report identical to one in train; 23.8% also share the reference. Exact-text overlap of test with train is only 0.03%, but a study-level re-check (shared image-study id, near-identical report) finds 39.0% of validation and 26.4% of test rows share a study with train. Validation ROUGE is likely inflated; AC1's unseen-report and study-disjoint subsets measure this.
- **Certainty cues** (keyword count). Hedges appear in 18.2% and negation in 62.7% of validation reports: a concrete autopsy target.
- **Memory.** Full FT needs about 4.0 GB for fp32 weights, gradients and AdamW states (16 bytes x 247.6M, activations excluded); LoRA trains 0.36% of parameters. Both are expected to fit one A100.

### 2.4 Risks, budget and fallback
- **Risks.** (i) Inflated validation ROUGE: AC1. (ii) `modules.py` forbids non-PyTorch libraries: staff confirmed `transformers` and `peft` are allowed for loading, tokenisation and LoRA, but the Trainer API is not, so the training loop and evaluation are written by hand. (iii) fp16 instability (reported, unverified): train in bf16. (iv) GPU queue: short interactive tests, then Slurm batch.
- **Budget** (cap set before any run). One A100 per job, <= 3 epochs per configuration, <= 24 GPU-hours total; a first-order FLOPs estimate puts one 3-epoch run at roughly 0.5 to 2 GPU-hours, to be measured.
- **Next experiment.** On Rangpur: zero-shot on validation, then short LoRA and full-FT runs to measure peak VRAM and tokens/s.
- **Fallback.** If full FT exceeds budget, use the same subsample or fewer epochs for both; FLAN-T5-small is the last resort.

**Outcome against the review.** AC1, AC2, AC3 and AC4 are met in Section 9. The budget estimate was too optimistic: one 3-epoch run took 2.2 to 2.4 GPU-hours (133 to 147 minutes), and the four final runs plus the learning-rate sweep stayed within the 24 GPU-hour cap.

Each module has a self-check: run `python dataset.py`, `python modules.py` or `python utils.py` directly, and `python train.py --self_check` or `python autopsy.py --self_check`.

## 4. Dependencies and reproducibility

**Exact versions** (`requirements.txt`; the reported runs used them on one NVIDIA A100-PCIE-40GB node of UQ Rangpur, Python 3.11.15, CUDA 13.0): `torch==2.13.0`, `transformers==5.19.0`, `peft==0.21.2`, `datasets==5.1.0`, `rouge_score==0.1.2`, `sentencepiece==0.2.2`, `matplotlib==3.11.2`, `numpy==2.4.6`. Every `metrics.json` records versions, GPU, host and git commit (with a `dirty` flag).

```bash
conda create -n torch python=3.11 && conda activate torch
pip install -r requirements.txt        # on a laptop use the CPU/MPS build of torch 2.13.0
```

**Data and weights are not in the repository.** The dataset (`BioLaySumm/BioLaySumm2025-LaymanRRG-opensource-track`) and `google/flan-t5-base` download from the Hugging Face Hub on first use (Rangpur compute nodes are offline: download once on the login node; `slurm/train.sh` sets `HF_HOME` and `HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1`). Checkpoints go to `runs/` (git-ignored). Without `--checkpoint`, `predict.py` runs the zero-shot model, so it works from a clean clone.

**Determinism.** Seed 0 fixes the training order, dev split, demo draw and autopsy draw; GPU kernels are not bit-exact, so reruns can differ in the last digits. Zero-shot ROUGE was identical on two different GPUs (Colab A100-SXM4, Rangpur A100-PCIE). Each configuration was trained once, so differences of about 0.6 points are not conclusive.

**Checks.** No GPU or weights needed (tokenizer only): `python dataset.py`, `python autopsy.py --self_check`. With weights and data: `python dataset.py --real`, `python modules.py`, `python utils.py`, `python train.py --self_check` (loss equals the model's own loss, schedule, loss falls on a fixed batch in full and LoRA mode).

## 5. Usage

```bash
# Smoke test (minutes on one GPU)
python train.py --mode lora --epochs 1 --max_train_samples 200 --max_eval_samples 100 \
                --output_dir runs/smoke

# One configuration, as slurm/train.sh runs it (torchrun, one process per GPU)
torchrun --nnodes=1 --nproc_per_node=1 --local_addr=127.0.0.1 \
         --rdzv_backend=c10d --rdzv_endpoint=127.0.0.1:29500 \
         train.py --mode full --lr 3e-4 --batch_size 8 --grad_accum 2

bash slurm/submit_final.sh      # the four final runs on Rangpur (zero-shot, LoRA r=8/16, full FT)

# Learning-rate sweep on the development set only (never touches validation)
sbatch slurm/train.sh --mode lora --lr 1e-3 --epochs 1 --max_train_samples 20000 \
       --skip_final_eval --batch_size 8 --grad_accum 2 --output_dir runs/sweep_lora_1e-3

python predict.py --checkpoint runs/full_lr3e-4/best      # demo; also --report "text"
python autopsy.py --runs_dir runs --out_dir autopsy       # autopsy evidence (no GPU needed)
python plot_results.py --runs_dir runs --out_dir figures  # figures of this README
```

`python train.py --help` documents every option. A run writes `best/`, `curves.png`, `metrics.json` and `val_predictions.jsonl` to `runs/<name>/`. With more than one process `train.py` uses `DistributedSampler` and `DistributedDataParallel`; Rangpur gives one GPU per node, so all reported runs have `world_size = 1`.

**Example inputs and outputs** (`predict.py` draws examples with a fixed seed from validation and test; they are not hand-picked):

| Report (input) | Full FT output |
|---|---|
| Aortic elongation. Subsegmental atelectasis in the left base. No significant findings. (test) | The aorta, which is the main blood vessel carrying blood from the heart, is elongated. There is a small area of lung collapse at the base of the left lung. No other significant issues are found. |
| Clinical diagnosis: syncope. Technique: No consolidation or pleural effusion is identified. Old subcapital fracture of the left humerus. (validation 673, ROUGE-Lsum 0.69) | The patient came in because they fainted. The x-ray didn't show any signs of pneumonia or fluid around the lungs. There's an old broken bone in the upper arm on the left side. |

Even in this fixed draw there are soft spots: "consolidation" became "pneumonia", and "No signs of pneumothorax" in test report 8376 became "no signs of air in the lungs". Test examples have no reference (blind test set), so no ROUGE is shown for them.

## 6. Data and pre-processing

**Dataset.** BioLaySumm 2025 LaymanRRG, open-source track [1, 6, 7]: chest X-ray reports (PadChest and BIMCV-COVID19, translated to English, and Open-i) with GPT-4o-written lay summaries (silver labels, not clinician-written). Train 150,454, validation 10,000, test 10,537. **Test summaries are withheld**, so all ROUGE numbers are on validation.

| Step (`dataset.py`) | Choice | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| Prompt | Fixed instruction placed **before** the report | FLAN-T5 is instruction-tuned; truncation can never remove the instruction |
| Truncation | 512 tokens (source and target) | Only 0.19% of sources and 0.24% of targets are longer |
| Target masking | Padding in labels = -100; `</s>` kept | Loss ignores padding, the model still learns to stop |
| Augmentation | Training cycles through four equivalent instructions; evaluation uses one fixed prompt | Report text is never edited: changing words in a clinical report can flip a negation |
| Tokenisation | On the fly, padded per batch | No tokenised copy of 150k pairs in memory |

**Split and leakage.** The spec asks for leakage-free splits; the official split is *not*: 45.1% of validation reports appear verbatim in training (mostly short normal-study templates such as "No significant findings."), and 39.0% of validation and 26.4% of test rows share a study (image-study id or BIMCV session; no patient id exists) with training. A lookup table returning the most common training summary of the same report already scores ROUGE-1 78.1 on those rows. Staff recommended keeping the official split for comparability, so the problem is handled by:

1. **Three nested evaluation tiers** on validation: *full* (10,000), *report not in train* (5,494) and *clean* (4,037: new report **and** new study).
2. **A 1,000-row development set cut from training**, whole studies at a time, used for every choice (learning rate, checkpoint); it shares no study and no report text with the remaining training rows (checked directly). Validation is used **once**, at the end.
3. **Excluding BIMCV sessions that repeat** from the dev set and the autopsy: in all 1,201 such sessions both rows carry the same report text but different summaries, so one pair is mismatched (train 2,226 rows, validation 146, test 30).

**Data artefacts found** (counted directly): 64 train and 9 validation references contain Chinese characters; 440 train and 31 validation references have a second summary glued on after `": "` (the first part is a near-copy of the source, copy ratio 0.97). The fine-tuned models learn the second artefact (Section 9.3). The OpenI study key is one per row, so shared OpenI studies are not detected (1.5% of training rows).

## 7. Model and training

* **Model.** `google/flan-t5-base` [3, 4] via the Hugging Face libraries [10], 247,577,856 parameters. The encoder, decoder and `shared` embeddings are tied explicitly after loading: in `transformers` 5.19.0 the FLAN-T5 tie flag silently re-initialises the encoder/decoder embeddings at random (found because the parameter count was two embedding matrices too high; `modules.py`).
* **LoRA** (`peft`): task type `SEQ_2_SEQ_LM`, target modules `q` and `v` of all 36 attention blocks, `r` in {8, 16}, `alpha = 2r`, dropout 0.05. Trainable parameters `r x (in + out)` per matrix x 72 matrices: 884,736 (r=8) and 1,769,472 (r=16), i.e. 0.357% and 0.715%, both under the 1% ceiling of the feasibility review (r=32 would be 1.43%).
* **Optimisation.** Cross-entropy computed by hand from the logits (fp32, `ignore_index=-100`); AdamW (weight decay 0.01); linear warm-up over 5% of the steps then linear decay to 0; gradient clipping at 1.0; **bf16 autocast on fp32 weights**; 3 epochs; micro-batch 8 with gradient accumulation 2 (effective batch 16, 28,023 optimiser steps); seed 0.
* **Model selection.** After each epoch ROUGE-Lsum is computed on the dev set and the best epoch is kept (epoch 3 in every run, dev still improving, so the models may be under-trained).
![Full fine-tuning: training and dev loss (left), dev ROUGE per epoch (right)](figures/curves_full_ft.png)

**Learning rates** were chosen on the dev set with short runs (1 epoch on 20,000 training pairs, A100). The best value was the largest tried in both modes, so the optimum was not bracketed (a limitation):

| Mode | LR | dev ROUGE-Lsum |
|---|---|---|
| zero-shot (epoch 0) | n/a | 29.00 |
| LoRA r=8 | 1e-4 / 3e-4 / 1e-3 / **3e-3** | 48.94 / 54.19 / 58.83 / **62.05** |
| Full FT | 2e-5 / 5e-5 / 1e-4 / **3e-4** | 57.41 / 61.73 / 63.90 / **66.12** |

LoRA r=16 reuses the r=8 learning rate. LoRA and full FT use different learning rates because LoRA typically needs a larger one.

## 8. Why this is a Hard problem

An encoder-decoder with 247.6M parameters rather than a classifier; two adaptation strategies (LoRA through `peft`, and full fine-tuning) compared inside one pipeline; a hand-written training loop with gradient accumulation, learning-rate schedule and bf16 autocast, launched with `torchrun` (distributed-ready code: `DistributedSampler`, `DistributedDataParallel`, rank-0 evaluation) as Slurm batch jobs on an A100; beam-search evaluation of 10,000 reports per configuration; multi-level leakage analysis before any model was trained; and a safety audit that goes beyond a metric.

## 9. Investigation of the open research dilemma

### 9.1 Quantitative benchmark (identical splits, prompt and decoding)

ROUGE [8] x 100 (F-measure, per-example mean, stemmer on; ROUGE-Lsum with one sentence per line). One run per configuration, validation split, Rangpur A100-PCIE-40GB.

| Tier | Configuration | ROUGE-1 | ROUGE-2 | ROUGE-L | ROUGE-Lsum |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Full validation (10,000) | Zero-shot | 31.31 | 11.63 | 28.32 | 29.28 |
| | LoRA r=8 | 73.53 | 55.77 | 68.73 | 70.66 |
| | LoRA r=16 | 74.16 | 56.67 | 69.42 | 71.30 |
| | Full FT | **76.29** | **59.95** | **71.91** | **73.63** |
| Report not in train (5,494) | Zero-shot | 32.71 | 13.70 | 28.90 | 30.33 |
| | LoRA r=8 | 70.09 | 49.63 | 63.79 | 66.64 |
| | LoRA r=16 | 70.80 | 50.74 | 64.60 | 67.41 |
| | Full FT | **73.61** | **54.96** | **67.82** | **70.39** |
| Clean (4,037) | Zero-shot | 32.58 | 13.79 | 28.89 | 30.25 |
| | LoRA r=8 | 69.82 | 49.34 | 63.58 | 66.42 |
| | LoRA r=16 | 70.56 | 50.47 | 64.40 | 67.22 |
| | Full FT | **73.42** | **54.71** | **67.61** | **70.24** |

Every number in this table was recomputed from the stored per-report predictions and the references with `rouge_score` directly (largest difference 1e-12).

**Reading the table.**
* Fine-tuning gives +41 to +44 ROUGE-Lsum. The zero-shot model mostly **copies the report back** (its output shares 92% of its words with the input, against 33 to 35% for the fine-tuned models), so it scores about 30 whatever the tier.
* Full FT > LoRA r=16 > LoRA r=8 on every tier. With single runs, the 0.6-point gap between r=8 and r=16 is not conclusive, and the 2.3-point gap between LoRA and full FT holds for *these* settings (q and v only, one learning rate each), not for LoRA in general.
* The leakage effect is small: full validation exceeds the clean tier by 3.4 (full FT), 4.2 (LoRA r=8) and 4.1 (r=16) points. The unseen-report and clean tiers differ by at most 0.2 points.
* Reference point only: the best open-track system (T5-large, no LoRA, test set) reports ROUGE about 66.9 [2]; model size and split (test vs validation) differ, so it is not a comparison.

### 9.2 Resource profiling

| Configuration | Total parameters | Trainable (%) | Peak VRAM, train (GiB) | Peak VRAM, generation (GiB) | Train time | tokens/s* | Latency (s/report) | Checkpoint |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Zero-shot | 247,577,856 | 0 | n/a | 6.22 | n/a | about 213 | 0.377 | n/a |
| LoRA r=8 | 248,462,592 | 884,736 (0.357%) | 15.1 | 6.24 | 146.6 min | about 318 | 0.172 | 3.4 MB |
| LoRA r=16 | 249,347,328 | 1,769,472 (0.715%) | 15.1 | 6.25 | 145.3 min | about 336 | 0.162 | 6.8 MB |
| Full FT | 247,577,856 | 247,577,856 (100%) | 19.6 | 6.68 | 133.0 min | about 536 | **0.101** | about 1 GB |

All four rows: one A100-PCIE-40GB, micro-batch 8 x gradient accumulation 2, generation with beam 4 and batch 32, bf16 autocast. Peak VRAM is `torch.cuda.max_memory_allocated` in GiB. Latency is generation seconds divided by the number of reports (amortised over a batch, not the delay of a single request). *tokens/s counts generated tokens up to the first end-of-sequence token; the `metrics.json` files of these runs contain an over-count (padding after finished beams was counted), fixed in `utils.py` afterwards, so the column was recomputed by tokenising the stored outputs (about 54 tokens per report for the fine-tuned models, 80 for zero-shot).

* LoRA lowers training memory by about 4.5 GiB, but not by the ratio of the parameters: activations dominate (attention memory grows with the square of the padded length; an earlier smoke run at micro-batch 16 peaked at 28.8 GiB).
* LoRA generates **slower** than full FT (1.6 to 1.7x) because the adapters were not merged into the weights; `merge_and_unload()` before deployment should remove the gap (not measured).

### 9.3 Clinical safety autopsy

**Why not ROUGE.** ROUGE counts shared words. The self-check in `utils.py` shows it: for the reference "there is no collapsed lung", the inverted "there is a collapsed lung" scores 0.80 and the correct paraphrase "the lung has not collapsed" only 0.40.

**Case selection** (`autopsy.py`). The rule was written, with a fixed seed, before any case was inspected, so the choice is not cherry-picked. The pool is the clean tier minus repeated-session BIMCV rows, the four validation rows already shown by `predict.py`, and reports under 8 words (3,877 rows). One case is drawn from each stratum:

| Stratum | Rule | Probes |
|---|---|---|
| A | full-FT ROUGE-Lsum >= 0.70, but negation or hedge differs between source and output | does a high score hide a change of meaning? |
| B | source names an acute finding and the output is much shorter | omission of an acute finding |
| C | lowest 5% of full-FT ROUGE-Lsum | failure tail |
| D | LoRA copies the source (>= 90% of its words), the reference does not | layperson readability |
| E | random | control |

Two honest notes. Stratum B was calibrated badly: lay summaries are usually *longer* than their report, so no row met the 0.6 length ratio and, after the one allowed relaxation (0.8), a single candidate remained, a 498-word CT report. A first run of the selection also had a regex bug (contractions such as "didn't" were missed); fixing it changed the stratum-A draw and the earlier, already-read case was discarded. The readings below are non-clinical (drafted with AI assistance and reviewed by the author, not by a radiologist).

| Case (row) | Source and scores (ROUGE-Lsum: zero-shot / LoRA / full FT) | What went wrong | Root cause |
|---|---|---|---|
| **A** (6886) | "Prominent hila of vascular origin are observed" (+ sternotomy sutures, cardiomegaly). 0.28 / 0.64 / **0.72** | (a) LoRA **invents a cause** ("likely due to increased blood flow"); full FT **moves the finding** to "the lung bases" (hila are central). Both **add a hedge** ("likely") the source does not have. | Rare term mapped to a template phrase; the *reference itself* adds "likely due to vascular reasons" and the models imitate it. ROUGE ranks the output with the wrong location higher. |
| **B** (5788) | 498-word thoracoabdominopelvic CT ending in tumour progression. 0.51 / 0.50 / 0.55 | All outputs stop before the conclusion: (b) **"tumor progression" omitted**. LoRA: "same size; however, they have gotten bigger" (a contradiction); full FT: "contiguous loop" becomes "**congested** small intestine", "suspicious for malignancy" is cut to "no new spots suspicious"; (c) jargon kept ("ileocecal valve", "presacral"). | Input truncated at 512 tokens **with no warning** (very probable: every output ends at the same place), and almost no long reports in training (4 of 10,000 validation sources exceed 350 words). The reference also contains a Chinese paragraph (artefact). |
| **C** (512) | Cardiomegaly, peribronchovascular markings, a lingular area "possibly" related to COVID-19. 0.12 / 0.13 / 0.12 | Outputs follow the source and keep the hedge; "lingula" stays unexplained (c). The faithful outputs score **lowest** because the reference ("both lower parts of the lungs show areas of solid cloudiness") omits the heart and COVID: it looks like a mismatched pair. | **Label defect**: ROUGE punishes the faithful model, and zero-shot, which copies the source word for word, scores the same. |
| **D** (2118) | "Air trapping is noted. A pseudonodular image in the lingula, likely a vascular artifact..." 0.32 / 0.40 / 0.57 | (c) LoRA copies the source verbatim ("pseudonodular", "lingula" untouched). Full FT copies it too, then appends `": "There is a condition where air is trapped in the lungs...` (a proper lay version). | Training artefact: 440 training references (0.29%) have the form `"<near-copy of source>": "<lay text>"`; full FT reproduces it in 63 of 10,000 validation outputs, LoRA r=16 in 31, zero-shot in 0. |
| **E** (5402) | "Infiltrate likely of infectious or inflammatory origin. Chronic parenchymal changes." 0.17 / 0.72 / 0.81 | Faithful. Full FT keeps "likely"; LoRA says "a sign of", slightly firmer. | Control: the models usually behave. |

Five cases illustrate mechanisms, not rates. To size them, cheap checks were run over all 10,000 validation reports (`autopsy.py`).


**Negation and hedge flags.** A flag means a negation or hedge word present in the source is missing from the output, or the reverse. It is only a *candidate*, because lay summaries paraphrase ("without relevant findings" becomes "doesn't show anything significant"):

| | negation lost | negation added | hedge lost | hedge added |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Reference (GPT-4o) | 2.1% | 3.8% | 2.2% | 6.7% |
| Zero-shot | 6.7% | 0.0% | 3.3% | 0.0% |
| LoRA r=16 | 0.8% | 3.1% | 1.5% | 4.9% |
| Full FT | 1.1% | 3.4% | 1.6% | 5.0% |

The fine-tuned models change these flags no more often than the reference does. In a hand-read sample of 8 "hedge lost" cases (full FT), 5 were hedges inside a negated phrase (harmless), 1 a missing keyword and 2 truly raised certainty ("opacity suggestive of atelectasis" became "a small area of lung collapse is seen"). About 10.7% of full-FT summaries carry at least one flag.

**Copying and reading level.** 0.74% of full-FT and 1.12% of LoRA r=16 outputs copy at least 90% of their words from the source (references: 0.21%). The Flesch-Kincaid grade (syllables approximated) is 14.4 for source reports, 7.5 for references, 15.1 for zero-shot and 7.5 to 7.6 for the fine-tuned models; the spec's target is about 6, which none reaches, the reference included.

### 9.4 Discussion

**Q1. Does fine-tuning preserve clinical fidelity or only improve fluency?** Both fluency and register improve, and fidelity is *largely but not reliably* kept. Evidence for: negation and hedge flags change no more often than in the reference, most outputs in the cases are faithful, and zero-shot is only "faithful" because it copies and is not lay language (grade 15). Evidence against: every fine-tuned model produced something absent from zero-shot: an invented cause, a displaced finding, a contradiction, a silently dropped conclusion. These are new kinds of error that a copying baseline cannot make. I cannot give an error *rate*: five cases and keyword proxies are not an audited sample, and no radiologist reviewed them.

**Q2. Why does ROUGE not guarantee safety?** (i) It counts overlapping words, not meaning (inverted-meaning example above). (ii) In case A the score ranked the output with the wrong anatomical location above the one with the correct description. (iii) In case C faithful outputs scored 0.12 because the reference was defective, and the model that merely copied scored the same. (iv) References are model-written silver labels that contain embellishments (an added "likely") and artefacts, so matching them can be wrong. (v) Choosing checkpoints by ROUGE pulls the model towards GPT-4o's style, not towards correctness. (vi) Memorisation inflates it (3 to 4 points here, more in other splits).

### 9.5 Recommendation to the project manager

**Q4a. Which configuration?** For a single-task service, **full fine-tuning**: best ROUGE on every tier (+2.3 over LoRA r=16 on full validation), fastest generation (0.101 s per report; unmerged LoRA is 1.6x slower) and similar training time. It costs 4.5 GiB more training memory and about 1 GB per checkpoint. Choose **LoRA** (r=16, 6.8 MB) if several tasks or sites need separate variants of one base model, or if memory is the limit. On the safety indicators measured here the two are not distinguishable, except that full FT reproduces the junk-tail artefact twice as often (0.63% against 0.31%).

**Q3. Guardrails required before any patient-facing use**, each tied to an observed failure:

| Guardrail | What it does | Evidence | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Input length check | Reject or split inputs beyond the model window; confirm the output covers the whole report | Case B; test reports are longer (median 48 against 32 words) | not implemented |
| Output sanitiser | Cut at `": "`; reject non-English characters; reject outputs that copy the source (>= 90% of words) | Case D; 0.63% junk tails, 0.74% copies | simple rules, measured here |
| Entity / negation / hedge verification | Extract findings, negations and certainty words from source and summary; any mismatch goes to review | Cases A, B; about 10.7% of full-FT summaries flagged, many harmless | keyword version measured; a trained extractor would be more precise |
| Confidence filtering | Route low-likelihood summaries (beam-search sequence log-probability) to a person | proposed | not tested |
| Human review | A clinician approves every summary with an acute finding or hedge until an audit shows otherwise | all cases | process |
| Data hygiene before retraining | Remove references with the `": "` or Chinese artefacts and mismatched BIMCV pairs | Cases A, B, D; 440 + 64 training references, 2,226 mismatched-session rows | not done |

**Deployment risks (Q3).** Radiologists reviewing LLM-simplified reports have likewise flagged incorrect passages and missing information [9]. Here: silent truncation; fluent but invented causes or displaced findings that look trustworthy; certainty changes in both directions; copied jargon; labels written by a model, not clinicians; one dataset of chest X-rays, largely translated from Spanish, so other hospitals, languages and modalities are untested; reading grade 7.5 against a target of 6; and no clinician-graded evaluation.

**Q4b. Go / no-go.** **No-go for an autonomous, patient-facing service.** **Conditional go for a pilot in which the model drafts summaries that a clinician reviews**, provided the first four guardrails are in place and a radiologist-graded evaluation set (hallucination, omission of acute findings, certainty change, with thresholds agreed with clinicians) exists before any patient sees an output. Reason: the model usually helps and sometimes invents, and ROUGE cannot tell which.

## 10. Limitations

* **Validation is not leakage-free** (45.1% report and 39.0% study overlap with training); mitigated by three tiers and a study-disjoint dev set, not removed. Test overlap (26.4% by study) cannot be scored (no references).
* **Silver labels and no clinical review:** references are GPT-4o output; no radiologist graded anything. The autopsy is five cases read without clinical qualification; keyword flags and the reading grade are approximations.
* **One seed per configuration**, no confidence intervals; LoRA and full FT use different learning rates, the best one was at the edge of the swept grid for both, and dev ROUGE was still rising at epoch 3.
* **Scope:** FLAN-T5-base only, LoRA on q and v only (alpha not tuned), chest X-ray reports, one dataset, one prompt for the baseline (a better prompt might raise zero-shot), augmentation not ablated, dev set resembles the clean tier more than full validation.
* **Resource numbers** depend on batch size, beam width and micro-batch, and are comparable only within Section 9.2; the tokens/s column was recomputed. Multi-GPU training was not run.

## 12. Artificial Intelligence Usage Disclosure

**Tools.** Claude (Anthropic) through Claude Code, for code scaffolding, debugging, drafting documentation and planning; literature notes were AI-assisted and every citation was checked against its source.

**What the AI helped with** (AI drafted, the author reviewed and changed): `dataset.py`, `modules.py`, `utils.py`, `train.py`, `predict.py`, `autopsy.py`, `plot_results.py`, the Slurm scripts, and the structure and wording of this README. The case readings in Section 9.3 were drafted with the AI and reviewed by the author.

**How it was audited, verified and tested:**
* **Self-checks:** hand-computed ROUGE examples, loss formula against the model's own loss, learning-rate schedule, token counting on padded rows, loss decrease on a fixed batch (full and LoRA), accumulation step counts, LoRA parameter counts against the closed formula.
* **Bugs the checks and cross-checks caught:** randomly initialised embeddings under one config flag; a 2.3x to 5.3x token over-count in `metrics.json` (found by re-tokenising the stored outputs); `trainable = 0` for LoRA; a macOS-only DataLoader failure; a regex bug in the autopsy selection. Each was fixed and re-checked.
* **Independent recomputation:** the ROUGE tables, evaluation tiers, overlap percentages, lookup baseline, dev-split disjointness and artefact counts were recomputed from raw data and predictions with separately written code and matched.
* **Platform check:** zero-shot ROUGE identical on Colab and Rangpur. **Not verified:** multi-GPU training and any clinical judgement.
